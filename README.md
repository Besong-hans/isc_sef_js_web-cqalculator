#Web Calculator

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional web-based calculator using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division), handle user input via buttons and keyboard events, and
display results in an intuitive way.
